# DiffDock_GPU

This respository takes the majority of its source code from the main DiffDock repository, found [here](https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock).
It was copied over here and not forked in order to enable some restructuring of the file system and inclusion of dockerfiles for CPU and NVidia GPU implementations.

## How to Use:

### CPU 
Very slow.
Will add instructions for set up soon.


### GPU 
Only works on Cuda.
Make sure you have your drivers installed.
Will add instructions for set up soon. 

### Inference 
Will add instructions soon.
